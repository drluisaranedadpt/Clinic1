    Campus Orthopedics Physical Therapy, Inc. appreciates the confidence you have shown in choosing us to provide your rehabilitation needs. Our goal is
    to return our patients to pre-injury function as safely and efficiently as possible through the judicious
    selection of physical therapy modalities and procedures. We believe that the patient should take an active
    role in the decision making process regarding their treatments.
</h6>
<h6>
    We emphasize the importance of a good attitude and hold a zero tolerance policy for bad attitudes or disrespect
    within our office. We believe that a great attitude makes a massive difference in the Physical Therapy office in
    an open environment where fellow patients are present. Rehabilitation will get difficult, but remember to remain humble.
    Accept that you will have pain and discomfort, and appreciate that these are opportunities to improve your impairment
    and disabilities. With a good attitude and hard work, you'll be able to accomplish a lot more!
</h6>
<h6>
    Passion is just as important as attitude. If you are passionate about your rehabilitation you will definitely have a great time!
    Remember why you are here when times get hard and when the exercises and activities get heavy. Your passion for learning and
    improving will help you through the Physical Therapy program. If you find yourself in pain and frustrated from treatment, a casual
    5 minute break helps a lot as well to clear your mind and your discomfort. You should plan to spend between 45-60 minutes in our office.
