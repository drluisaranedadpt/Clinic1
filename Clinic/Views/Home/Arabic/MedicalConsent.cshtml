            I have been informed about the expected benefit, and alternative methods of
            treatment(s), and I understand that <strong>I can refuse</strong> any procedure prior its performance.
            I understand that the practice of physical therapy usually requires the treating
            therapist to physically touch the patient in order to evaluate and or guide the patient the proper
            way to do an exercise so as to expedite healing or allow the therapist to feel how
            the body is reacting to certain movements, which can further educate the treating
            therapist on what therapy modalities need to be altered to fit the patient, therefore
            I consent to such physical interactions with my treating physical therapist.
            I hereby consent to the procedure(s) which may be perform while I am patient of
